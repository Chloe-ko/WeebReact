1.  Tag-system
2.  Tag-search (include and exclude, clear tags button)
3.  Settings
4.  Other sorting/filter options (eg. only certain filetypes, sort by when added)
5.  Instead of importing pictures, make a system to chose a folder and use all pics inside, actively scan for changes inside of directory
5.  when changes are done while program is off, check changes on startup
    If pictures are missing from directory and there are new ones, check if they've been renamed using hash (xxhash)
6.  Preview and additional details page when clicking on a pic
7.  Context Menu for pictures (Show in folder, remove, ..)
8.  Thumbnails for .mp4 and .webm files
9.  Selection feature to add/remove tags from multiple pics at once
10. Design! Needs animations for look cleaner
11. Built-in updater
12. If all else is done and I get no other ideas by now and some people actually would use it -> Cloud functionality!
    Really only if people would use it.
    1. Account system
    2. Registration
    3. Login
    4. Ban System (in case people upload bullshit or spam with the intention of annoying others) (based on network interface MAC address https://github.com/scravy/node-macaddress)
    5. Functionality to share own reaction pics and download the pics others uploaded
    6. Comment System (At this point I practically made my own booru image system)
    7. Friend/Subscription System to get notifications if they added more pics to the cloud
    8. Report system
    9. If people use cloud system and userbase gets bigger, request system if someone wants a certain pic

    NOT needed in cloud functionality:
    Messaging system, rating system
    Supposed to be a cloud to share reaction pics and memes, not a social platform
