A program to organize Reaction Pictures using a tagging system specially made for this kind of usage.
I'm to lazy to add proper descriptions to every commit until the program is at least in a working state. Once it is, I'll add proper descriptions to every commit.

I'll also eventually clean up the code, but since I am not too familiar with the Electron framework yet I have to test around a lot to get things working, hence the code will be somewhat unclean for now.
Once all the important things are done I'll make the code far cleaner.

TODO:

- fix special characters in tag names
- list tags in edit tags dialogue
- exclude function
- fix error message when no internet access

- sign installer
- change updates to use GitHub
- write download homepage

For after important stuff is done:

12. If all else is done and I get no other ideas by now and some people actually would use it -> Cloud functionality!
    Really only if people would use it.
    1. Account system
    2. Registration
    3. Login
    4. Ban System (in case people upload bullshit or spam with the intention of annoying others) (based on network interface MAC address https://github.com/scravy/node-macaddress)
    5. Functionality to share own reaction pics and download the pics others uploaded
    6. Comment System (At this point I practically made my own booru image system)
    7. Friend/Subscription System to get notifications if they added more pics to the cloud
    8. Report system
    9. If people use cloud system and userbase gets bigger, request system if someone wants a certain pic

    NOT needed in cloud functionality:
    Messaging system, rating system
    Supposed to be a cloud to share reaction pics and memes, not a social platform

Done: Mostly everything
