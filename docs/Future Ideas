Cloud functionality
    Really only if people would use it.
    1. Account system
    2. Registration
    3. Login
    4. Ban System (in case people upload bullshit or spam with the intention of annoying others) (based on network interface MAC address https://github.com/scravy/node-macaddress)
    5. Functionality to share own reaction pics and download the pics others uploaded
    6. Comment System (At this point I practically made my own booru image system)
    7. Friend/Subscription System to get notifications if they added more pics to the cloud
    8. Report system
    9. If people use cloud system and userbase gets bigger, request system if someone wants a certain pic

    NOT needed in cloud functionality:
    Messaging system, rating system
    Supposed to be a cloud to share reaction pics and memes, not a social platform
